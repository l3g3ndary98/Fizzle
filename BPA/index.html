<h2>Eating Healthy:</h2><p> Eating right is important to staying at a healthy weight and keeping an energy balance, the balance between the calories in what you eat and drink, and calories you burn when moving. The best way to make sure you have energy balance is to make better choices before you or your family sit down to eat. Make sure to choose foods that are lower in fat and have fewer calories, shop “smart” at the grocery. learn to read the nutrition facts label on packaged foods, and choose healthy foods more often.</p>

<p>Make sure to review dietary guidlines, you can check out http://www.choosemyplate.gov  The information on this website comes from the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which are issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Agriculture every five years. The guidelines can help you make healthy choices that can reduce your chances of getting some diseases, like heart disease and diabetes.
</p>

<p>Another smart choice is to eat smaller portions. In many cases, the amount of food that appears on your plate when eating out has nearly doubled over the past 20 years. And that has affected the way we look at and serve food at home, too.

<h2>Getting Active:</h2><p> By getting active, you're using calories you store up from everything you eat over the course of a day. Everything your family eats and drinks (from what you eat for breakfast to what you drink with dinner) is stored as energy. If this stored energy isn't used, it creates an imbalance that can lead to weight gain. Some types of physical activity and exercise can burn a lot of energy. But everyday activities use energy, too. Simply parking farther away from the grocery store and walking the extra distance can use more energy.
</p>

<p>It's up to you to choose the activities that are right for you. And, it's also up to you to stick with it. It is easy to spend a lot of time sitting in front of the computer or television. It's the same for kids. They spend hours sitting at their school desks, sitting at home doing homework, and sitting in front of the TV or computer.
Fight the urge to slouch on the couch. Instead, get up and go. Set an example for the kids in your life. Moving more can do more than just help your waistline, it can make you healthier by relieving stress, improving your sleep, making your bones and muscles stronger, making you feel full of energy, building strength and endurance, helping you feel good about yourself, giving you something to do when you’re bored, and providing a way to connect to family and friends.</p>
